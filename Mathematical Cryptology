Mathematical Cryptology (MC) is a forum for original research articles connecting Mathematics and Cryptology. 
Foundational and applied contributions relating to Mathematics and Cryptology are equally welcome. By default, 
all submitted manuscripts must contain an original research contribution. When submitting an extended version of 
a conference/workshop contribution, the additonal contribution over the prior version has to be indicated clearly. 
Survey articles can be considered, if they have potential to advance a particular line of research.

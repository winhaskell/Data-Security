Data Security

Data security is the process of maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s data in a manner
consistent with the organization’s risk strategy. Before an incident happens, companies must have a security architecture and response plan in place.
Once an incident occurs, they must be able to detect the event and respond accordingly. After the incident, the company must be able to recover effectively and efficiently.

NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence is actively working with industry experts and technology vendors to address the most pressing data security challenges. 
These efforts result in practical, standards-based guidance that organizations can implement in part or full to meet their security and privacy needs.
